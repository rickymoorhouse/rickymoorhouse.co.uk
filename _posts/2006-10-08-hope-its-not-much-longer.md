Yesterday things were quite variable after the initial burst of activity. 




While we were waiting for the midwife we had a surprise visit from Michael at the door, which threw us completely as he didn't look much like a midwife! By the time the midwife arrived the contractions had died down quite a bit, but she checked the usual stuff and Laura's temperature and all seemed fine.




Last night though, Laura had a very disturbed night and is now very tired, but the contractions are coming stronger. She's been finding it quite tough, but is doing really well. Thank you to those of you that are praying for us - it's greatly appreciated and I'm sure it makes a difference.




Hopefully the baby will arrive at some point today - and I'll keep you informed!
