I've been thinking of putting a list of the firefox extensions I use on my blog for a while, and then [Dean](http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com) [listed](http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com/archives/001388.shtml) the extensions he finds useful and asked what anyone else was using - so I decided I should post it! So here is my list of firefox extensions:



[All in one gestures](http://perso.wanadoo.fr/marc.boullet/ext/extensions-en.html)

    Extension that helps you to navigate the web just using the mouse - includes mouse gestures and extra wheel navigation


[Web Developer Extension](http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/)

    Very useful extension with lots of CSS tools and tricks which is especially useful for designing and testing webpages


[Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/)

    Sidebar RSS Reader for Firefox

[Livelines](http://heygom.com/extensions/)

    Changes the live bookmarks icon to add RSS feeds to Sage


[IE View](http://ieview.mozdev.org/)

    Useful for testing pages to check that they work both in IE and Firefox, also for the pages that are designed not to work in Firefox.


[Link Toolbar](http://cdn.mozdev.org/linkToolbar/)

    Site navigation toolbar - useful for navigating blogs and forums - provides buttons for next and previous pages (and other related pages - but I use next and previous most)


[OpenBook](http://www.chuonthis.com/extensions/)

    Extension to open the bookmarks dialog with the full tree automatically


<del>[Colorzilla](http://www.iosart.com/firefox/colorzilla/)

    Useful extension to check what colour things are! - Can pick up colours from pictures and webpages and copy them to the clipboard in different formats
</del>

<del>[Autofill](http://autofill.mozdev.org/)

    Automatically fills in forms - like the same feature from the google bar
</del>

    Backs up a copy of my bookmarks to my website



[Scrapbook](https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&version=1.0+&id=427)

    For taking notes and recording websites



[HTML Validator](https://addons.update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=249&os=ALL&application=firefox&version=0.10&go=Go)

    For checking website source code
