![](/ricky/blogfiles/autumn.jpg)Well I'm now 23! It's a bit strange having my birthday in autumn instead of spring, but it's quite nice! I love the autumn colours, and it's also great to see a different place in autumn. Unfortunatly, it's been very cloudy these last few days though, so I missed getting a photo of the yellow leaves against the blue sky, but this should do for now! It was a really nice birthday, although any post from England still hasn't got here - so it'll be a long birthday :). In the morning I opened my presents from Laura - she got me Lee Strobel's [A Case for Christ](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0310209307/ref=sr_aps_books_1_1/202-4004511-2727023), [Love Actually on DVD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000UI2QY/ref=sr_aps_dvd_1_1/202-4004511-2727023), a pen, notebook, some sweets and later on in the day, a scarf. We then went out to a restaurant that we'd not tried before - we both had Chicken with salad, and didn't know what to expect. The salad turned out to be a sort of apple and cheese coleslaw and was really tasty.
