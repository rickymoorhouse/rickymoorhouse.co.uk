![Peri Peri Ketchup](http://samespirit.net/ricky/images/periperi.png)This morning just as I was getting ready to leave for work I came back through into the dining room to see Laura and Abi, but Laura was in there on her own. - Abi had gone off for an explore as she's been doing more and more recently. When I got through to the living room, I saw Abi had got some thing in her mouth, and unusually it looked quiet big, so I went round to investigate further and discovered she had the lid to our Nandos' peri-peri ketchup in her mouth covered in ketchup and the bottle was laying on the floor next to her.




Now I find the ketchup quite hot, so can only have a small amount - but she didn't seem to have a problem with it! Fortunately the bottle hadn't spilt on the carpet - just on the leg of her sleep suit.
