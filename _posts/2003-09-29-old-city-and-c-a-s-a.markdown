Today we wentto the old city (Ciudad Vieja), we visited the church of the Most Holy Trinity (Sant√≠sima Trinidad) and the diocese offices, then went to see C.A.S.A (Anglican Centre for Solidarity & Help) where we met Billy, who Daniel is teaching Spanish. We did a bit of Spanish together, and then we went for lunch with Paulo & Sandra. After lunch, Paulo showed us some photos, we rested for a bit and then I drew a dove for them to use with the Alpha course. In the afternoon Luis showed us round the old town. In the evening we prayed together with Luis & Daniel in the chapel which is part of the house. We went through the service for daily prayer from the Book of Common Prayer in Spanish and it was really good.
