Had our first parents evening at Abi's school this evening and it was really nice. She seems to have a great teacher who understands her and gets where she is and what she needs. Even though Abi is doing really well with her reading (about at the level expected at the start of year 2) she still wants to get her to move on 3 points during her time in the reception class - to roughly the expected level at the end of year 2)

One story she told us was of everyone being told that if their sheets didn't have their names on they'd be thrown away and if they needed help to go to an adult for help. At the end of the lesson she was looking through the sheets surprised that so many had names on, then recognised that it was all the same handwriting and that Abi had been writing the other children's names on their sheets for them!
