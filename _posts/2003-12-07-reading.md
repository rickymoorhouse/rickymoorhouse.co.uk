I did the reading in church for the first time in Spanish today. It went ok, however Gilberto had originally told me a different reading, as he'd got the wrong page in his book of readings. So I'd prepared to read 1 Thessalonians 3:6-13and then when it came to the reading he realised it was a different one! So I ended up reading Philippians 1:1-11instead. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, I think I only made one major mistake!
