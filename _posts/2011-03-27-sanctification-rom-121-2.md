<blockquote>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
Romans 12:1-2, ESV</blockquote>


"Do not be conformed to this world" is in the passive as it is something that happens subconsciously so we need to make a conscious effort not to let this happen.
