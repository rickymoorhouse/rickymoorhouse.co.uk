![](/ricky/images/shiraz.jpg)We had this over a week ago, and it's took me a long time to get round to posting it, so I'm too late for the round up anyway! We've not had Shiraz before, and weren't that keen on it.   
The wine was a bottle of [Wolf Blass](http://www.wolfblass.com.au/) Eaglehawk 2003, and had a slightly blackberry like smoky aroma. It was a too sharp for our tastes really, as we generally prefer something a bit smoother.   
From the Wolf Blass website: _The 2003 Eaglehawk Shiraz is a fruit driven style with a
bouquet of lifted spice, plum and red berry fruit
characters and subtle oak overtones. The palate is of
medium body, showing soft complex fruit flavours with
rich berry characters. Soft tannins help finish the wine
with a dry lingering finish._
