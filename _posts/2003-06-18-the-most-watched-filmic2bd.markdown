[BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3076809.stm) is reporting on the most watched film in history! It was made to take the gospel to far corners of the world and has been translated into 760 different languages, but hardly heard of in the UK. Sounds interesting to get a copy of to watch. There's clips on it's [website](http://www.jesusfilm.org/)
