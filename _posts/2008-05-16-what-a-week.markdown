#### Friday




Went to the doctors to get Abi an appointment as the bits of her rash that she'd been scratching still hadn't sorted themselves out and the phone lines for the doctors were broken.




At the doctors she was prescribed antibiotics (flucloxacillin) which was bright pink and tasted disgusting; and understandably, she refused to take them after the first taste (and this seems to have put her off medicine in general since).




In the evening, we took up my parents offer of babysitting Abi and went out to Gunwharf. When we got back we heard that Abi had seemed hot and been kneeling up in her sleep. Then later on as we went to bed she woke up obviously upset and hot - her temperature was 38.6.





#### Saturday





In the afternoon we attempted to ring the out of hours doctor as Abi ... and they said they'd phone back - which they did but it took nearly 2 hours. When they did they had the usual thing to say - keep on doing what you're doing, keep giving her the antibiotics, alternate Calpol and Ibuprofen, sponge her down to keep her cool.





#### Sunday





In the evening Abi's temperature peaked at 41 degrees and she was very drowsy, so we phoned the out of hours doctor again and this time insisted on seeing someone. We went to see them up in Cosham and as we set off she seemed to brighten up - she had seemed asleep and Laura told her we were going to see the doctor she sat up and said "doctor".




The doctor said to keep on with the same and if her temperature was still high to take her to see our doctor on Monday.




#### Monday




The doctors phones were still broken so I took Abi round to the surgery to get an appointment. The appointment was half an hour later so I took Abi for a walk before returning to the surgery. When the doctor examined Abi he said he was concerned she was getting dehydrated and that we should take her to the childrens unit at the hospital to be checked out. 





When we got to the hospital, the nurse gave Abi an initial examination (which included her standing on the scales to be weighed for the first time) and then gave her some Calpol to bring her temperature down. This seemed to do wonders and when the doctor came back to examine her she was much more lively and her temperature was normal - which amazed us as our Calpol hadn't seemed to have much of an affect and they only gave her 3ml where as we'd been giving 10ml. (As we found out later they use the Calpol 6+ and work out the exact amount to give based on her weight - 10kg). The doctor noticed that Abi's tonsils looked sore, which would probably explain the reluctance to eat/drink. She decided to change the antibiotics to something that would deal with both her throat and the infected patches of rash (amoxi-clav) and to keep her there a bit to give her the first dose of antibiotics and for her to drink some more. 





We were in the hospital until about 2 o'clock during which time Abi had a few small sips of water which they seemed to be happy with. By the end of our time at the hospital we felt quite dehydrated ourselves as it we hadn't had enough to drink - as we only had enough money for the car park and 2 rolls for lunch and to get water we had to ask at the ward reception.





#### Tuesday




Took a day off work to help out and Abi seemed much better and we had a nice day all together apart from the stress of forcing her to have antibiotics




#### Wednesday




Went into work and had a phone call from Laura to say that Abi's rash had flared up and the doctor had said it was probably glandular fever because the combination of glandular fever and amoxicillin would cause that sort of a rash. Because of this, they changed the antibiotics again. I went home at lunchtime and worked from home in the afternoon as I was worried about Abi having glandular fever.




#### Thursday




Worked from home as I'd planned and Abi seemed generally quite well, although she had was very insistent about going for walks or being in the garden and was quite grumpy and tantrumy when she didn't get her own way. Still doesn't like having the antibiotics either.




#### Friday




Abi's rash seems to have all gone this morning apart from the infected patches, which are looking much better. She was better at swallowing the antibiotics, but still had to force them into her mouth - looking forward to finishing the course of them.
