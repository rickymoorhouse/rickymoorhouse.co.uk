After seeing that one of the contestents on Masterchef this week had cooked butternut squash risotto, it made us fancy it ourselves. I had a look for a recipe in some of the usual places, and then decided to make one myself (with a little help from the example risotto on the back of the rice packet).







  * 1 Onion (finely chopped)


  * Handful of mushrooms (chopped)


  * 1 litre of light vegetable stock


  * 150g Risotto Rice


  * Blob of Butter


  * Butternut Squash (cubed)


  * Couple of sprigs of fresh parsley





  1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees C


  2. Drizzle Butternut Squash with Olive Oil and roast for 30 minutes


  3. Once the Butternut Squash has been roasting for about 15 minutes, heat the butter in a frying pan and add the onions - fry them until the are soft.



  4. Add the mushrooms followed by the stock and rice and stir.


  5. Leave the rice mixture to simmer until all the water has gone (should be about the same time as the butternut squash is finished)


  6. Mix in the squash and the fresh parsley and serve.
