Today we went to the 'double service' at Esp√≠ritu Santo, which is a service in Spanish, followed by a service in English. It was really helpful to be at both, and interesting to see the differences. We then went for lunch with the Carters. After lunch, Steve taught me how the guitar chords are done differently here. All the chords have different names as follows: C is DO, D is RE, E is MI, F is FA, G is SOL, A is LA, B is SI. For minor chords, sometimes lower case is used, and sometimes an 'm' is added. I'm starting to get used to it, but it's very tricky.
