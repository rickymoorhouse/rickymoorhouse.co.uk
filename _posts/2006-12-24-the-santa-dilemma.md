To Santa or not to Santa - that is the question!




![Santa](http://samespirit.net/ricky/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/santa.thumbnail.png)This year, Abi isn't old enough to understand much of whats going on at Christmas, but we're soon going to have to make a decision about what we're going to do about Santa. I just don't like the idea of lying (directly or indirectly) to her about it. I guess I'm slightly worried that if she sees us making up something like this and then her finding out later whether she'll doubt other things that we've told her. On the other hand - Santa would bring a lot of enjoyment and excitement for her (and us), and stimulate her imagination. What does anyone else think about this? Am I just being silly?
