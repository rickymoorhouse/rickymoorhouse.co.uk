Last week, we went up to Rivera with Gilberto. Rivera is the Uruguayan half of a city on the border with Brazil (The Brazilian side is Livramento). The Anglican church here has got a 'mission' up there, well really a small church, which they've set up and are running with the help of the Anglican church in Livramento.




We had to leave Salto at 4 in the morning from the bus station - so we went to sleep first and set the alarm. I managed to sleep more on the bus, which made it easier for me. When we got there (at about 9), we went straight to a hotel, and checked in there in time for breakfast.




It was a very different place to Salto - the main street was full of 'free shops' (duty free), and people speak a strange mixture of Spanish and Portuguese, which was very bizarre - speaking to people in Spanish and them replying in Portuguese
