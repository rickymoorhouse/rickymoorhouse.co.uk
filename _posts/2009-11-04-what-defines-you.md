<blockquote>

> 
> Blessed is the manâ€¨,  
who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,  
nor stands in the way of sinners,  
nor sits in the seat of scoffers;  
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,  
and on his law he meditates day and night.
> 
> 
Psalm 1:1-2 (ESV)</blockquote>




To be blessed is to know God's favour and experience true happiness. This blessing comes from taking counsel from God rather than from those who have rejected his counsel, the wicked. It's important to know whose advice and counsel you are following and whether it is rooted in God or in human sin and rebellion.




Jesus has taken our sin on himself through his death on the cross so now we have a new identity in him. Therefore we should stand out from the world rather than blending in with the sin that surrounds us. As Philippians 2:14-16 says, we should contrast so much from the world around us that we shine like stars in the darkness.  Is your life defined by your sin or your Saviour?




We all find our delight in something and have things that bring us joy and these are what shape our life. Where does your joy come from - do you delight in God's word or in your sin?




Do you delight in reading and meditating on God's word and dedicate time to  it, implanting it into your heart and mind?
