Today we took Abi to the doctors for her second set of jabs. The waiting was awful - we were both dreading it, and Abi was being her usual sweet and gorgeous self. When we finally got in to see the nurse, Abi burst out in giggles - it was lovely, but we didn't think it would last. 




So then it came to the injection and she was quiet, and then a few seconds afterwards had another little giggle! Unfortunatley the second injection didn't have the same effect - she wasn't happy after that one, but it didn't last and she'd soon cheered up and was smiling and giggling again




What a bizarre baby :) She's lovely!
