At Jessica's [school](http://manorinfantschool.co.uk/year-groups/chick-cam), where I am a governor and Laura works, they've got an incubator of eggs from [Living Eggs](http://www.livingeggs.co.uk/hatch-a-chick/), so that the school can watch as they hatch into chicks.

On Monday I got a text from Laura wondering if it would be possible to set up a webcam to watch them hatch.  We happened to have a wireless webcam that wasn't being used so that evening I got it out to make sure it was working and configured it with an FTP server to upload photos every minute and if there was motion detected.

The next day I took the webcam into school and got it set up with the help of James who looks after the school computers and network. You can see the[ latest pictures from the webcam on the school website](http://manorinfantschool.co.uk/year-groups/chick-cam).

In the early hours of this morning the first egg hatched:
