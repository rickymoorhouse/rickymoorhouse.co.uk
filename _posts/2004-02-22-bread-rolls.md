At youth group yesterday we had lots of bread rolls left over, so we decided to leave them in the fridge at the CAIF for Sunday to see if there was anyone who needed food. This morning at the service we got through the sermon and Gilberto was just about to start the Eucaristic prayer and realised that they'd run out of wafers! I don't understand why it was left to that point for him to find out though! Anyway, he was going to send Sendi home to find some bread, but she conveniently disappeared to the toilet. Then I remembered the bread in the fridge, so I got it and we had communion using have a finger roll. He still decided to dip it in the wine and put it in peoples mouths, and it was very squidgy - surprised he managed!!
