Laura has gone into labour - I think it all started about 1 o'clock in the morning. She woke me up at about 5 o'clock and told me that they were getting more regular. I was completely out of it and didn't understand what she was telling me until I'd got up and come downstairs! I thought we were supposed to be going somewhere!




[![Laura with her TENS machine](http://samespirit.net/ricky/images/lauratens.jpg)](http://samespirit.net/ricky/images/lauratens-large.jpg)Well she's now all wired up to her TENS machine and contractions seem to be about every 4 minutes. We've also got the birthing pool fully inflated and ready to fill.




She's just attempting to phone the midwife
