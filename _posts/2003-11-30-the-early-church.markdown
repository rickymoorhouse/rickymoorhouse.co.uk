Yesterday we went to a talk about the early church over at the Methodist church based on the book of Acts. It was really interesting, and surprisingly I managed to follow most of what the guy was saying (in Spanish) which was cool. Although I found the people asking questions difficult to understand, and when we were in smaller groups it was difficult. A very tiring day in all, but well worth it!
