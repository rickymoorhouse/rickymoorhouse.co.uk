We just got back from Concordia, after spending a couple of days there to renew our visas and have a bit of a break. It's amazing how different it is to Salto, there seems so much more stuff in the supermarkets (mainly in the line of cheap booze) and it seems much busier. We also felt a lot less safe there than we do in Salto - but nothing happened. We stayed in a cheap (-Ãº10 for a double room with breakfast) but lovely hotel, and wandered around the sites there. At some point I'll probably add some photos of the castle we went to see, and the cathedral, which looks quite different to any other Catholic cathedrals I've seen.
