It's suddenly got cold here in Salto! I've gone from walking around in shorts and t-shirt to wearing a fleece and jeans. We've had to put the 2 blankets on the bed rather than just sheets as we'd got used to, and last night we decided that we could do with a hot water bottle. So we used Sprite bottles filled with hot water - which actually did the job quite well!!  

Although it feels quite cold it's actually been quite a nice break from the heat. It's like a crisp sunny winters day back in England - although probably not that cold and it's still quite warm in the sun.
