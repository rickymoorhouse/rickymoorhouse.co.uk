We left Devonat about 6 in the morning in order to drop Greg off on the way to theairport. Got to the airport in plenty of time, and we were allowed tocheck in straight away Ã”?? without having to queue much! Got boardingcards for all the planes for our whole journey! The British Airwaysflight was good, had a choice of 13 different channels we could watch with about 6 different films! I watched X-Men 2, Anger Management and the last section of Italian Job.
