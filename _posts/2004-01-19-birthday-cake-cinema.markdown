It's Laura's birthday tomorrow so I've been making her a birthday cake. She wanted a bible shaped one, so I did my best - the shape is ok, but I encountered problems with the icing so it didn't end up with a verse on it! Then in the evening we went to see American Pie - The Wedding, - the cinema was the fullest I'd ever seen it here in Salto.
