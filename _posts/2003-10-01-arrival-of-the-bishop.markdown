Today I went on an errand with Fabio to move some plants from someone's garden to church of the Holy Spirit Ô?? They were big plants!! Then wewent on to the airport to meet Miguel and Martha as they arrived backfrom Cuba. Their flight was delayed for about 30 minutes and then whenthey arrived, we went via Espíritu Santo, and the British Hospital, as Miguel wanted to see how the building work was doing and to visitHeather in the hospital. We then all had lunch together back at thehouse.
