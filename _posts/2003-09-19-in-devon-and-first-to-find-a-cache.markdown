Well we're now in Devon - the drive down didn't seem too bad, the roads were pretty clear, and it took about the same length of time as we'd expected. Even the time we told my Grandma for stopping to see her on the way down worked out right! :)Today we were the first to find a geocache - it was hidden by the side of the road, so not the most interesting place for a cache, but still cool being the first to find it!
