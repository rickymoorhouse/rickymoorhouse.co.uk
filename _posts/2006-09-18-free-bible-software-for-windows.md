After talking about different bible software with some people at life group on Sunday, I thought I'd do a bit more investigation into some of the free bible software available. The main software I've looked at so far is: [In the beginning was the Word](http://theword.gr/en/), [The SWORD Project](http://www.crosswire.org/sword/) (for Windows). I also tried [MyBible](http://www.chip.de/downloads/c_downloads_11431704.html) - but didn't get past the installation, as it failed to download the texts.




Here's my initial findings,  I intend to investigate some others and post some more details as I use them a bit more later on...




#### In the beginning was the Word




##### Highlights






  * Clipboard Monitor that pops up a verse when you copy a reference from anywhere


  * Excellent Interface


  * Personal Note storage


  * Lots of texts available (including original languages)




##### Disadvantages






  * Doesn't have footnotes to the text


  * No cross references




#### SWORD Project (Windows)




##### Highlights






  * Lots of texts available (including modern translations)




##### Disadvantages






  * Difficult to use Interface


  * Flashes a lot when you change passage or settings
