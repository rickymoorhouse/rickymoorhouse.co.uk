We went to the local Zoo with the youth group today, as they're on holiday from school. It was nice, but quite a contrast to seeing the animals up at Iguazu. They all seemed to be in really small cages, apart from the deer, ï¿½andu and goats. The peacocks all had had their feathers cut off - possibly for selling for carnival costumes. The kids all seemed to enjoy the trip and have lots of fun, and we finished off with a ride on the spinning swings (don't know what to call it!), which was interesting as it appeared to be powered by little propellers, one on each side!
