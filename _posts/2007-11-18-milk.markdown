Abi now knows how to get her milk! First she'll use the sign for milk:







If we don't notice, she do it again with sounds and then sometimes if we're in the kitchen she'll point to her bottles followed by the fridge and the microwave (just in case we've forgotten how to!). One time she even went as far as to get the empty milk bottle out of the recycling bin and hold it up to me!
