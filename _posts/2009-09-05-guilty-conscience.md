One of Abi's favorite games recently has been to pretend to be on the telephone, having a conversation with someone and then pass the phone around saying "I'll just pass you over to Daddy". Today when she passed the phone over to me, we had the following conversation:



Me (talking on the toy phone):


<blockquote>

> 
> Hello?  

Really?  

Why did she do that?

> 
> 
</blockquote>


Abi (protesting profusely):


<blockquote>

> 
> I didn't!
> 
> 
</blockquote>
