This morning Laura spotted a spider in the bath and asked me to remove it. I picked up the spider and showed it to Abi. I then took the spider outside. Abi slammed the door behind me and screamed in protest.




When I came back without the spider and shut the door, she held out her hand as if to hold the spider and said "Abi loves spider"
