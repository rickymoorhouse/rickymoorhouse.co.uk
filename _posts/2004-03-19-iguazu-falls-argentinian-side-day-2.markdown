![](/resize.asp?width=200&path=/ricky/blogfiles/falls.jpg)![](/resize.asp?width=200&path=/ricky/blogfiles/turtle.jpg)Today we went to the park again and had a bit of a less hectic day. We started off by doing the high tour around the tops of some of the falls - which was lovely apart from the annoying hoards of tour groups there. After that we had pizza for lunch and went back out to the devils throat to take the ecological tour boat back along the river. That was really nice and peaceful, and we saw 3 turtles, an alligator and a black splodge which was supposedly a toucan. After this we took a bit of a walk down the Macuco trail to try and see some monkeys - there were lots of giant ants, and we saw something that looked cat like but unfortunatley no monkeys. In the evening Laura & I went to the "Corner Restaurant" and had a lovely all you can eat buffet (15 pesos including desert!)
