On the plane over Des met a guy who'd recently brought property here, who could recommend an estate agent for us to contact. So in the morning he gave them a ring, and their colleagues took us for a drive round 3 of the properties for sale, and a few others that had been sold and done up, so we could see some of the things that had been achieved. The properties gradually got better throughout the day as in the amount of work that needed doing on them but they all had potential.<!--[Asparuhovo](http://bgmaps.com/map.asp?sid=a73650cb07c6f97df1906db3be2e73c2&size=4x3)-->
