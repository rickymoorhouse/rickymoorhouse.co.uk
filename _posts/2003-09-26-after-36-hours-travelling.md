After along journey we arrived in Montevideo around lunchtime where we were met at the airport by Daniel (from Texas) and Fabio. We got through the airport so quickly that we had left before Steve Carter (one of the other SAMS missionaries) got there. When we got to the Bishops house, Fabio cooked lunch for us. In the early evening, we went to the beach with Daniel and Luis and had our first "Mat√©"?? inUruguay!
