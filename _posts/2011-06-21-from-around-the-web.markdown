Here's a few articles I've read recently that are helpful and challenging:

In [Reminders Are More Effective Than Rebukes](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tullian/2011/02/14/reminders-are-more-effective-than-rebukes/), Tullian Tchividjian reminds us of the need as Christians to regularly remind each other of who we are in Christ, rather than focusing on our sin and that we re-focus on Jesus for "because of Christ’s work on your behalf, God does not dwell on your sin the way you do"

[A prayer for strength for one of those days](http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/scottysmith/2011/06/16/a-prayer-for-strength-for-one-of-those-days/): Dear Lord Jesus, it’s looking like one of THOSE days ... Am I whining? Yes I am, Lord, but I’m bringing my bad attitude and my very busy day to you.

[10 Things That Keep Us From Mission](http://theresurgence.com/2011/06/13/10-things-that-keep-us-from-mission) looks to be a challenging series on the Resurgence and well worth following.

In [Speaking with Contempt](http://redeemercitytocity.com/blog/view.jsp?Blog_param=361), Tim Keller warns against the natural temptation to respond to criticism with self-righteous contempt towards the critic.
