Late afternoon on Sunday I had an urge to do some cooking and in the end decided to make Cheese Straws with Abi - it was nice and simple, but lots of fun. It's amazing how much Abi can understand and follow instructions and she was able to do quite a lot of the cooking. She added the ingredients to the bowl, helped to mix the ingredients together roll out the mixture and put it onto the baking tray to cook.   


Laura took some great photos of us, and the cheese straws were delicious.
