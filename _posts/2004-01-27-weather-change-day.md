This morning I updated the weather on the [samespirit] front page to be the forecast for Salto rather than Montevideo, which I've been thinking about doing for a few days. Interestingly though, the same day - the site I was originally getting the weather forecast from changed the way they do their page so it would have broken my weather script if I hadn't changed it!
