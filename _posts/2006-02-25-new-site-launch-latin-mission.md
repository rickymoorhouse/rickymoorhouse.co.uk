Recently I've been working on a new community website which I've just launched:  

[Latin Mission](http://www.latinmission.com) is a new community site for people with an interest in Christian work in Latin America.  It currently consists of:





#### Forums




The forum is a place members can discuss recent events, their Latin American experiences or even seek prayer support.





#### News




The news section collects news from across the internet and filters it to show news items relating to Latin America.  The sources currently include BBC News, Google News, Newsvine and Christian News Service





#### Stories




As a community site, all members can submit stories or articles to the site that others can read and comment on.
