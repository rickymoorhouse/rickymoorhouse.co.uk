A while back I saw that [Pete](http://twitter.com/#!/petegillam/) had posted this [on twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/petegillam/status/22275239102648320), and we decided it was worth a try - since then I can't remember how many times we've made them as it's so simple and tastes good!Â  Just posting it on my blog so it's easier to find in the future!


### Ingredients





	
  * 4 tablespoons flour

	
  * 4 tablespoons sugar

	
  * 2 tablespoons cocoa

	
  * 1 egg

	
  * 3 tablespoons milk

	
  * 3 tablespoons oil

	
  * A splash of vanilla extract (we didn't use this)

	
  * 3 tablespoons of chocolate chips (optional)




### Directions





	
  1. Combine the dry ingredients in a large coffee mug

	
  2. Add the egg and mix together

	
  3. Pour in the milk and oil, mix

	
  4. Add the chocolate chips and vanilla extract (if using)
