BBC News: [Uruguay vote rejects oil policy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3300199.stm): Unusually, there's an article on BBC News about something that happened in Uruguay!! Everyone here has been talking about the referendum for the last few weeks and there's been graffiti around saying to vote "Si" ever since we arrived! Here in Salto there were 2 processions, the first one with the tambores (see picture) and the second one with hordes of pedestrians with flags chanting something that sounded like an anti US chant followed by cars hooting away. We got the perfect view from our sixth floor balcony over looking the main street.
