Today we had a lovely outdoor service in the church garden, because the church has been getting very hot, and last week I commented to Gilberto that it would be nice to have a service outside sometime. By the sounds of things, others had mentioned it too. It was nice, a bit noisy though -but everyone seemed to think it was good so I think we're having another one on Sunday. After the service we had a small party for Laura's birthday (a week late - but still nice) One of the unexpected guests is in the picture - he sat there quite happily while I took his picture, then jumped off!
