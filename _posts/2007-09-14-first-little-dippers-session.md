After problems with the weekend workshop that we'd originally booked on we finally got round to Abi's first swimming lesson today. 





She seemed a bit nervous as we were waiting to get into the pool and watching the previous class finish as they did they're underwater swims and being thrown towards their parents. However she loved it once we were in. She loved having the other babies (She was the oldest in the group for a change) around and watching them and seemed to have lots of fun with the lesson itself. She did very well with her holding onto the side and loved her splashing into the pool as usual. The highlight though was floating on her back - she's never been particularly happy with floating and I hadn't got the hang of how to hold her before, but they showed us a different way to do it and she was brilliant - she seemed to love it.
