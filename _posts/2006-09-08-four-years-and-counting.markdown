This weekend Laura and I celebrated our fourth wedding anniversary by having a nice relaxing weekend away over at my parents caravan on Hayling Island (more on that to follow). It's amazing how time has flown by in these four years, but it's been wonderful and lots of different things in each one of them!







  * 2002 - 2003 - My Graduation, preparing for Uruguay


  * 2003 - 2004 - Mostly in Uruguay


  * 2004 - 2005 - Laura's last year at Uni and lots of church stuff


  * 2005 - 2006 - Pregnancy and moving House
