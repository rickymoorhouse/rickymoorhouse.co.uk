<blockquote>And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment,  so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. (Philippians 1:9-11, ESV)

We see elsewhere in scripture, that the Philippians excelled at showing love, both to others in need (2 Cor 8:1-5) and to Paul (Php 4:15-16) - however Paul still prays for their love to abound more and more. Wherever we are on our Christian walk, there is never a reason to stop growing in love or in knowledge. We must continually strive to grow in love for our fellow Christians - not a romantic love, but a love of caring that shows itself in real practical ways. The main reason for this is  as Jesus said, "By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."

Paul then goes on to pray that this would be with knowledge and discernment so that the Philippians would know what is right, do those things that are in accordance with Gods will and in turn be pure and blameless when Jesus returns.

approve what is excellent- which comes from God's word - as we grow in knowledge of God's word this leads to better discernment as to what is right, and in turn to us being pure and blameless.

Pro 1:7 says "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction."

God wants us to be holy (Lev 11:43), that is,  pure and blameless and He is working in us by his spirit to achieve this.

Psalm 119:9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.

Because of what Jesus has done, we are made free from sin

As Paul prayed for the Philippians to abound in love with knowledge and discernment - so must we - both for ourselves and for one another.

The reason for this is so that we live in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
