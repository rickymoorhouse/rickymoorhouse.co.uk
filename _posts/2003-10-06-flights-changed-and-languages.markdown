We got our flights changed first thing at the American Airlines office by the seafront, so we will now be travelling back at the start of July and having a one-night stopover in Miami on the way back to break up the journey. We then went down to CASA to meet Daniel and have a Spanish lesson - which was interesting as he was teaching one person English, and 3 of us Spanish at the same time! After the lesson we went for lunch together.
