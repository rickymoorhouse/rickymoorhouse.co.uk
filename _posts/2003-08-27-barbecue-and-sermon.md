At last! - I finished my sermon this morning - before leaving for the morning service. I've had a very hectic week - all cumulating in this one day! Katrina's fundraising barbecue for us was brilliant - It was fun, and managed to raise 311.36 through it! It was really nice that my parents were able to come along too.
Then this evening I did my sermon. Preaching for the first time was scary - I was very nervous. I felt it had gone badly, but everyone else thought it was good - so I guess it must have been.
