I'm now up in Nottingham, well I've been here since last Tuesday, been having a good time. Got ourselves a travel adapter, and been attempting to find a cheap external CD-Writer - so far no luck! We went to Beeston Evangelical Free Church  yesterday evening, which was really nice, and seemed very friendly. The sermon was on Acts 24:22-26:32,and was interesting - particularly the links between the Herrods, and Agrippa, Drusilla and Bernice and how they had all reacted to Paul's message. Also, on this site I've added some of my icons to my portfolio pages!
