Well we fly back home today leaving Montevideo at 5.50pm, everything is pretty much packed and Jonathan is going to give us a lift upto the airport. Just a few more goodbyes to say and check our mail before we go. It still feels strange that we´ve finished here and are heading back, but it will be nice to see our families, as we´ve definitely missed them. But it´s going to be strange adapting back to life in England after our time here.




We´ve had a nice week in Montevideo, but it´s been strange - having left Salto, and finished, but not having gone home yet. It´s been great to catch up with everyone down here. Also we managed to time it just right for Daniel´s birthday party which was great fun.
