Had a brilliant bible study in the Barrio today, looking at the 4 different set readings for today. It was really cool - I got a lot from it and felt able to contribute which was good. The readings were [Genesis 11:1-9](http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Genesis+11:1-9&version=NIV&language=english)(The tower of Babel), [Psalm 37:1-18](http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Psalm+37:1-18&version=NIV&language=english), [Hebrews 6:13-20](http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Hebrews+6:13-20&version=NIV&language=english), [John 4:1-42](http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=John+4:1-42&version=NIV&language=english)(Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan women). They seemed to link together quite well - the tower of Babel, where the people sought their own achievements ignoring God; the Psalm which told us to trust in God, walk in his paths and listen to him; Hebrews which talked about the certainty of Gods promises; and in John, Jesus saying his food was to do& complete the will of his father.
