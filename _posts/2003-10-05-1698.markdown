We went to the English service at the cathedral this morning - it was strange, as it seemed to take more effort than the Spanish ones we've been to! We got the bus back home, and then had lunch with Miguel, Martha & Gonzalo. In the afternoon we went to the dedication of the new church building for Esp√≠ritu Santo. It was a really nice service, with so many people that there were lots of people standing outside!! After the service, there was a reception with lots of food where we met Gilberto.
