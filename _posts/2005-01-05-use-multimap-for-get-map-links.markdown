I can't remember where I found it, so I thought I'd put this here so I don't loose it!   
  

In user.js or about:config, find mail.addr_book.mapit_url.format
and set it to:  


http://www.multimap.com/map/places.cgi?addr2=  

@A1&addr3=@CI&pc=@ZI&db=GB&client=public&  

cname=Great+Britain&advanced=true&mapsize=big  

  

Or for streetmap use:

postcode2map?@ZI
