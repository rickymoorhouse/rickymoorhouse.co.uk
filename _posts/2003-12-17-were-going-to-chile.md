While we were in Montevideo, Jorge invited us to go to the provincial youth congress in Chile - a 5 day event for youth leaders. We will be travelling by bus via Buenos Aires and will be a long (The section between Buenos Aires and Santiago is 22 hours) but very scenic journey !The event should be really helpful for us both in language, leadership and spiritually. When we get back, we're going to be starting a youth group here along with a girl who approached Gilberto about one while we were in Montevideo. Tonight Gilberto mentioned the youth group and we told him about the congress and he was really encouraging.
