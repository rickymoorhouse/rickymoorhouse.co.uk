We had a really good home group tonight, looking at three little verses from Johns gospel on the subject "Accept Jesus as Lord and Friend" - For the first verse, I asked if we could read the verses just before and after it. With having a little bit more to look at we had a really great discussion and everyone seemed to contribute at some point. This is a great improvement from the previous weeks, where the study has been very short and not gone into much depth. We touched on all sorts of cool bits which people had seemed to have had a bit of a misunderstanding about - so that's promising! Here's a some verses that I was thinking of part of during home group when we were talking about the difference between society, and Jesus' instruction to love one another as he loves us: If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death--even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. I might add a bit more on this tomorrow, but I'm tired now!
