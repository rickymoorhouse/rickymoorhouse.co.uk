What a week! Last week Laura was told that there could be a shortage of midwives available for her homebirth, so might have to go into hospital (or the Mary Rose Birthing Centre - which is just a wing off the labour ward now.). So because of this we decided it was worth writing to the supervising midwife to express our thoughts and to request support for the homebirth in writing. 

Yesterday, we got a response back from her deputy saying that there was no staffing shortage, it is unplanned illness and that they provide lots of options for birth locations. Although currently there are none actually in the city, other than homebirth, as the birthing centre that is being rebuilt won't open until November. 

After reading the letter we were pretty annoyed - firstly that she hadn't really read and replied to Laura's letter properly and secondly the lack of interest or support. 

However today, we had a really good appointment with Laura's normal midwife and she was very helpful and supportive. Just hope that the baby comes before her holiday
