I had Friday off work as that was our actual anniversary, and we planned to head over as soon as we were ready on Friday morning, stopping for breakfast on the way.


However, on Friday morning as we'd just about got all our things ready to go, Laura saw a mouse run behind the cupboard in the dining room. I moved the cupboard, and sure enough, out darted the mouse back across the room and it was gone! We decided we should probably do something about it, so we packed up the car, went to get a trap, and I popped back in to set it. Laura had waited in the car and we'd been meaning to head straight off from there, but I managed to lock the keys in the house :(! After a few attempts to get back in we decided to call a locksmith, who came and in a matter of seconds he had the door open! After the paperwork had been sorted, we were off to celebrate our anniversary!





Once we were on our way, we went up to Sainsburys at Farlington and were still just in time to have a cooked breakfast in the cafe there. It wasn't the nicest of food, but we were both ready for it and it was such a relief to be on our way! We got our shopping done for the weekend and then headed down to the caravan for a nice relaxing afternoon. For dinner we'd booked a table at the Langstone hotel, where we had a lovely 3 course dinner whilst watching the sunset over the water. I had a Mushroom starter followed by Asparagus stuffed chicken and a Vanilla and Coconut dessert, which was all delicious and beautifully presented. 





On Saturday we went over to Bosham to have a look round and had a picnic lunch by the water. We timed it just right to arrive as the tide was coming in and by the time we'd finished our lunch, the road along the waters edge had been covered by the tide! In the evening we headed over to the eastern coast of Hayling to watch the sunset and took loads of photos, some of which I'll upload at some point
