For a while I've been turning off iptables to let my secondary machine connect as [synergy](http://synergy2.sourceforge.net) client to let me use one keyboard and mouse across both machines. Â Finally today I decided to set up the rules properly to do it, so here's how:

Create a new rule file in the iptables chain directory for incoming rules:


    
    sudo vi /etc/iptables.d/filter/INPUT/53-custom-synergys.rule







with the following lines in it:


    
    # Allows incoming flows for Synergy.
    -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 24800 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 24800 -j ACCEPT



Restart iptables for the rules to take effect


    
    sudo /etc/init.d/iptables restart
