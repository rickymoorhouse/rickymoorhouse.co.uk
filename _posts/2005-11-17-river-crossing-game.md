Ka Ho sent me this [game](http://freeweb.siol.net/danej/riverIQGame.swf) today - it can get frustrating but it feels quite an achievement when you finally manage! The instructions are as follows:




  * Only Mum Dad, or Policeman can operate the raft


  * Robber cannot be left alone with family


  * Girls cannot be left alone with dad


  * Boys cannot be left alone with mum


  * Select two people onto the raft, click red lever to operate
