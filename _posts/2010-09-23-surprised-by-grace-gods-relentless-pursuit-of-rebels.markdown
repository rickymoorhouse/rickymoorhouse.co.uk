[![Surprised by Grace: God's Relentless Pursuit of Rebels](http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1275863068m/6945363.jpg)](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6945363-surprised-by-grace)[Surprised by Grace: God's Relentless Pursuit of Rebels](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6945363-surprised-by-grace) by [Tullian Tchividjian](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/788130.Tullian_Tchividjian)

My rating: [5 of 5 stars](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/119303943)

Very clear and challenging look at the book of Jonah, showing us that the gospel is not just for those who haven't yet heard it but something that we as Christians need to keep coming back to.  The book of Jonah points us to God and how he deals with Jonah's rebellion and ultimately our own rebellion.
