Interesting image of the site - Of course - having put this post here will probably change what the result is anyway!




Here's the explanation of the colours:


<blockquote>
blue: for links (the A tag)  

red: for tables (TABLE, TR and TD tags)  

green: for the DIV tag  

violet: for images (the IMG tag)  

yellow: for forms (FORM, INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT and OPTION tags)  

orange: for linebreaks and blockquotes (BR, P, and BLOCKQUOTE tags)  

black: the HTML tag, the root node  

gray: all other tags
</blockquote>
