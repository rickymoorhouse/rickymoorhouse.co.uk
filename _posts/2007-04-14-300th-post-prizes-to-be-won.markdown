I just noticed that this would be my 300th blog post so I decided to do something a bit different. Firstly, I'd get my wife to write this post. Secondly anyone who comments on this post within the next week will win a prize - the better the comment, the better the prize ;)




My blog started back on June 2003 with [this](http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/80) insightful post.  Since then I have explored life living in a [foreign land](/ricky/news/Uruguay), have pondered upon new advances in [technological masterpieces](/ricky/news/Firefox) such as Firefox and revealed my thoughts on [life as a daddykins](/ricky/news/Abigail).




So please comment so that I feel that all this has not been in vain.




My humble thanks




Ps the prizes will be really really good
