Announcing the birth of...

#### Update...




She weighed 5 lb 12 oz and was born at home in the birthing pool, just as we'd hoped. This was a particular answer to prayer, as earlier the midwives had told us that there was a possibility we would have to go into the birthing centre, as the labour ward was short staffed.   
However God provided us with 2 excellent midwives who were keen to ensure we had the home birth that we wanted, and they battled for us for it with the hospital. 




Laura's contractions were advancing and she was keen to get into the pool, but worried about being told to get out again, I called the church prayer chain, to get them to pray for us.   
Minutes later the midwives had a phone call from the hospital saying that they could stay.
