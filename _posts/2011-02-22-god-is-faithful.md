Since downloading the Fighter Verses iPhone app, I've started slowly to try to memorise the verses from scripture - Here's some of my notes on the first one.


In the verses leading up to this, God reminds his people  that it is because of his  promise to their ancestors that he has rescued them from Egypt and instructs them on how to deal with the nations around them, particularly cautioning them not to enter agreements or intermarry with the people he told tehm to destroy.

God has set apart his own people to be special to him, not because of any greatness or achievement of their own. Because of this evidence of God's love for them, carried out through the generations, they can be assured that God will continue keep his covenant.

God sets himself apart from the false gods of the surrounding nations.  He is the one true God who will loyally keep his covenent agreement. His love stands firm amidst the changing world, he is the only one that can be depended on, and they can see that from their history.  His people are called to be loyal to him, love him and keep the commandments - reflecting the way he loves us.
