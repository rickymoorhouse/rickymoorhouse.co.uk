I seem to have started more books than I can read at the moment, currently I've got the following on the go:






  * The Bible - Both NIV and ESV (currently reading through Exodus, and dipping into 1 and 2 Peter)


  * Know and Tell the Gospel - John Chapman


  * Effective Men's Ministry - NCMM


  * 15 Minutes Alone with God for Men - Bob Barnes
