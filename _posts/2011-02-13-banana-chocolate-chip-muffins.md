Had a lovely afternoon making these Banana & Chocolate chip muffins with Abi and Jessica:[![](http://rickymoorhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/20110213-154812.jpg?w=300&h=223)](http://rickymoorhouse.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/20110213-154812.jpg)

I'd used the last 2 eggs at lunchtime so when we decided to do some cooking I searched for recipes without eggs - turns out that the best thing to search for is eggless recipes. I then found the [recipe for these muffins](http://www.egglesscooking.com/2010/08/09/banana-chocolate-chip-muffins/) which after I made a couple of alterations to, we had all the ingredients for. We all had fun making them and they were delicious, although unfortunately I decided to only make half the quantities so we only had 6! The recipe with my alterations is below (makes 6)


### Ingredients





	
  * 1 cup self raising flour

	
  * ¼ cup oats

	
  * ½ cup sugar

	
  * 6 squares of chocolate (chopped up)

	
  * 2 bananas (mashed)

	
  * ¼ cup sunflower oil

	
  * 2 tblsp water




### Directions





	
  1. Pre-heat the oven to 190°C

	
  2. Mix the mashed banana, oil and sugar and water together to create a smooth paste.

	
  3. Mix in the flour, oats and chocolate pieces.

	
  4. Spoon carefully into muffin cases, about 3 tsp of mixture per case

	
  5. Cook for 20 minutes.
