I know this video has been on Laura's facebook for a while, but I wanted it here too as it's sooo cute!




Abi has been doing so well with her swimming and it's lots of fun taking her. Last week, she had her first solo underwater swim - which meant she swam between the instructor and me underwater. (It was only a very short distance, but amazing!) Tomorrow is her last session of the current term, which seems to have flown by, but we're now booked onto the next term so it'll only be a weeks gap in between.
