Over the past few weeks I've been reading a selection of articles on design and design theory, so I decided to make some tweaks to my blog design to try out some of these ideas.

Overall the new design is pretty similar to how it looked before, but some of the key things I've changed are:





#### Tabs now look a lot better</h4


I've changed the tabs to use a roll-over image instead of CSS colours and hackery. This makes it look more consistent across different browsers and I think it looks tidier.




#### Typography




The whole design has much more of a vertical rhythm to it than the previous version and the font sizes and colours have been more thought out. 




#### Background Image




I thought the main content area looked a bit white, so I decided to add a bit more colour with a nautical chart (well a tracing of one) of Kefalonia - the same place as the original photo for the header image was taken.




#### Removal of timeline




I was finding that it I was just having to click an extra time to get to the latest entries in my blog, so I've decided to go back to a more traditional blog front page.
