Laura's gone back home to spend the week looking after her sister - so it feels empty around the house. Tonight I'm going to my Uncles 60th birthday - which should be good, just have to remember how to get there again!! I really should have brought my camera to work so I'd have it with me for the party, anyway I'm sure we'll go over there again before we go away!
