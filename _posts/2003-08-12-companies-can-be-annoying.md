After phoning O2 at the weekend to arrange to have my phone disconnected in October when the contract runs out - they very quickly and efficiently disconnected my phone immediately! I phoned them back later on and they said they'd reconnect it for me. Still nothings happened - so tonight I phoned again and after holding for 30 minutes they told me they couldn't do anything until the cancellations team were in tomorrow!
