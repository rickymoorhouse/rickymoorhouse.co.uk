Left Santiago later than had been planned -we arrived at Rucahue at about 3 and then had lunch - salad and pork steak. We attempted to get a room together, but in the end decided it was too much hassle for everyone. The evening worship was excellent, and the sermon was on Philippians 3 - about avoiding Legalism, and that knowing Christ is what is important. I had to move beds as the one I thought I'd found once already taken! In the end I slept on the floor -quite comfy! In the evening there was a session - panoramic vision of the bible, which was really interesting and I managed to follow it!
