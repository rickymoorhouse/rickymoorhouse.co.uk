We've had a fantastic day today - done loads and now I'm exhausted!



We started off with visiting the [Portsmouth & Hampshire Art Society](http://www.portshantsart.org.uk/) at the Portsmouth Cathedral - there were some fantastic pictures there and Abi enjoyed it particularly the boat pictures. Then we had to dash off to a Kati, Dillon and Duncan's birthday party that Abi had been invited to, which was really nice as there were lots of our friends from church there and Abi had lots of fun playing with the other children.




After the party we went back to Stef and Gerard's house to borrow a thing to put on the side of Abi's bed so that she doesn't fall out, and we ended up staying for quite a while. Abi had fun playing with Tyler, Laura loved holding their little baby Daniel and I had a good chat with Gerard. 




This afternoon we went down to Gunwharf Quays to get Abi some new shoes and decided to go up the tower as well. As there's a "Meet the Navy" event on at the dockyards, we had really good views of all the extra boats that are around the harbour for that. Abi had great fun up the tower, and loved the glass floor - she walked very confidently on it, laid on it and even stayed there when people were jumping right next to her!   


Then we finished off the day with a barbecue.
