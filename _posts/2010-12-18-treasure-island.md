This afternoon we took the girls to the New Theatre Royal to watch Treasure Island, thanks to winning tickets in their twitter competition.

The set was really impressive with so many different things to spot with Abi before the show started, and had a fantastic ship's bridge, which doubled as the tavern entrance.

The show started with the beating of a drum and a fiddle player on stage, then the musicians took over and it developed into a big opening number, a combination which returned several times throughout, making great use of rhythmic elements intertwining with music from the excellent musicians.

There was a great balance of comedic and serious moments. The cast were fantastic and interacted well with the audience creating a great atmosphere.

The New Theatre Royal is a beautiful setting and all the staff were friendly and helpful. We had a really fun time and the girls both had a great time and got really into the show. If you can get to a performance, I'd strongly recommend it!
