title: Did Judas have a choice?

At breakfast there was hot chocolate this morning, but I didn't like it much - probably should have had it with half milk - half water. The study on John today provoked some interesting thoughts on Judas - he was chosen to take the part he did, but did he have a choice? The teachers seemed to think he was evil and greedy anyway. I went for a nice walk round the block with Laura, then swam, played table tennis and table football. In the evening things went on a bit too late again! They want us all to go to the devotionals in the morning at8.30 - so why not finish a bit earlier that 00.30?
