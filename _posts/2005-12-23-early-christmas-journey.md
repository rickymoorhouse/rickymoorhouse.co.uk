Well I'm now on holiday for Christmas - Yippee!





![Candy Cane](/ricky/images/candy.png)As the traffic would probably be really bad to travel down to Devon if we left it till after I finished work at lunchtime, so instead we decided to head down to Okehampton early this morning - leaving Portsmouth at 4.30am! This plan worked well as the traffic was fairly sparse on the roads at that time in the morning and we made probably the best time ever for the journey, arriving at about 7.30 in time for coffee and breakfast :).  I quite like travelling at the early hours of the morning, but it was surprising today how late it was before it started to get lighter.
  

  

So that's the first leg of our mammoth Christmas journey taken care of - the next leg will be on Thursday when we head up to Nottingham to see my family, via Burnham-on-Sea to visit my Grandma on the way.
  

  

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to anyone who reads this!
