    Can you go splish splish splish like a little fish?
      splish splish
    A fish that goes splish splish splish
    
    A fish goes splish splish splish
    But what goes splosh?
    
    A baby giraffe!
    
    <img src="http://samespirit.net/ricky/images/giraffe.png" style="float:left;"></img>Can you go splash splash splash like a baby giraffe?
      splash splash
    A giraffe that goes splash splash splash
    when he's having his bath splash splash
    
    A fish goes splish splish splish;
    a giraffe goes splash splash splash;
    but what goes splosh?
    
    An albatross!
    
    Can you go splosh splosh splosh like an albatross?
      splosh splosh
    diving in the sea splosh splosh
    when he's finding his tea splosh splosh
