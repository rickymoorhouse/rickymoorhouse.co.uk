After a nice (but busier than expected) few days in Montevideo, it's nice to be back to Salto. We've got loads of photos from the Synod, some of which will probably be online later on. We managed to meet up with lots of people through the 5 days we were there so it was good. We went to the Noche de los Luces which was a big firework display down by the river.
