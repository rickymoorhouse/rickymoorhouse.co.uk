Just had the first session entitled 'What is the gospel?' looking at Romans 1:1-6. Go Paul's introduction to the letter there is a nice summary.

From God...about Jesus...for everyone

The talks were all very good and left me with lots to think about.

I was particularly struck by the talks about heaven and hell, which gave a really clear explanation of the motives for evangelism. As when we die we are faced with either eternal life or eternal punishment as the situation is very serious. The last talk was very encouraging and challenging looking at sharing our faith with friends through the bible after prayer.
