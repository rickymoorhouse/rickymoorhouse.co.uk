Just a quick note about some useful HTML tags that have been around for a long time, but I've found particularly useful recently:





<del cite="_url_" datetime="_YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD_>

    Mark text that has been deleted, optionally citing a URL for more details and a date and time of change. Useful for marking alterations to posts.

    <del>Example deleted text</del>

< ins cite="_url_" datetime="_date of change_ >

    Mark text that has been inserted, optionally citing a URL for more details and a date and time of change. Useful for marking alterations to posts.

    Example inserted text

<dl><dt>_Term_</dt><dt>_Definition_</dt> </dl>

    Definition list - example is this list of tags
