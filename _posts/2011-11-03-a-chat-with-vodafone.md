The vodafone website doesn't seem to have any record of my data usage and is confused about how much I'm allowed (see screenshot below), so when I received a text from them saying I was near my limit (with no detail as to how close, just the price for going over) I decided to get in touch with them about it.

Here's the full transcript from my online chat with them, with just my personal details removed:




<blockquote>Ahmed: Hello, you're chatting with Ahmed, one of Vodafone's online customer service specialists. Â May I take your full name and mobile number please?

You: Hi it's Ricky Moorhouse and the number is <REMOVED>

Ahmed: Hi Ricky

Ahmed: How are you today ?

You: Good thanks. 

You: I don't seem to be able to check how much of my allowances I've used on my online Account on the vodafone website

You: and I just got a text saying I'm nearing my data limit so I wanted to get it sorted out so that I can see  
better how much I'm using

You: Can you see what is causing this?

Ahmed: I will check now

Ahmed: Thank you for the information. Could you also please provide me with the first line of your address and post code?

Ahmed: and your date of birth please ?

You: <REMOVED>

You: <REMOVED>

Ahmed: Brilliant

Ahmed: I found here that up to yesterday

Ahmed: You used only 183MB

Ahmed: Not to worry

Ahmed: Your allowance is 250MB

You: ah ok 

You: any idea why that doesn't show in my account online?

Ahmed: this what am working on now

You: ok thank you

Ahmed: Can you try to check that tab which is called unbilled usages

You: ok..just trying to get there it seems slow at the moment

You: so I'm on the My Bills page and there's the block saying what I've used since the last bill - is it the link "See your usage since your last bill" ?

You: ah then there is an unbilled usage tab

You: ok - that tells me how many minutes are used and remaining but no mention of data

Ahmed: ok

Ahmed: Is it showing on any other tab ?

You: for the previous bills it shows in the summary, but nothing for the unbilled/current period

Ahmed: ok, Do you have your mobile handy ? 

You: yes

Ahmed: Great dial 44555

Ahmed: It is free

Ahmed: and tell me what you will have ?

You: options for inclusive minutes or account balance

Ahmed: that is what it says on the screen ?

You: no it was a voice menu

You: I went for balance and just got a text 

Ahmed: ok check account balance

Ahmed: Super

You: that has the data usage in as you told me

Ahmed: What doe the text says ?

Ahmed: Great

Ahmed: Does that clarify the situation for you? 

You: It gives me a way of getting the information so that's good - I was hoping to be able to use the website or the iPhone app - but if they're not going to work at least I can get the information

Ahmed: Am quite sure there is something on the web site keep looking

Ahmed: am sure you will find it

Ahmed: Is there anything else I can do for you today?

You: I will do, I have been looking every couple of weeks since signing up to vodafone but I could still discover it

Ahmed: Keep checking

You: ok

Ahmed: I hope you find it

Ahmed: Is there anything else I can do for you today?

You: Thank you</blockquote>


**Update 3rd Nov 3pm:** Phoned Vodafone today about this and they suggested that I could find the total at the bottom of the unbilled calls section, but after 21 pages of bill it turned out there was no total. In the end they agreed that there was an issue so they've raised it with the technical team to look into and I should hear back within 3 working days - but they might have to delete my account in the process :O
