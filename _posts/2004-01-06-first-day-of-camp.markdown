First full day of the camp - woke up at 7.15 in plenty of time for the devotional at 8.30 which was on Galatians - the theme of Christ living in me. Then we had breakfast - which was really nice and consisted of yoghurt, hot bread and tea or coffee. Then we had the study on Johns gospel which was brilliant. In the afternoon we went up to view point where we could see mount Chillan. There were quite a few clouds, but it was brilliant. In the afternoon I went swimming. This evening I moved into the leaders cabin, as there was space there - It's huge and quite different to the others!!
