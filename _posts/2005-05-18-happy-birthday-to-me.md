It was my birthday back on 5th May, I know this is a bit late – but I’ve been quite busy but still wanted to blog about my birthday! I had a great day - thanks to my lovely wife Laura. First of all she got me breakfast in bed – Egg Muffin :D then I opened my presents (well apart from the ones from my parents which I’d opened the night before). I think my favourite present has to be my smoothie maker that Laura bought me, which was totally unexpected- but has provided no end of tasty drinks!   

After this we got up and went to vote, then came back for smoothies and birthday cake before heading off geocaching to Old Winchester Hill, which is a really nice country park with great views all round. We could even just about make out the Isle of Wight in the distance. After a nice walk and picnic we found the cache and then headed back to meet up with my parents at Queen Elizabeth Country Park, where we had another walk. Then in the evening we went for dinner:

<blockquote>
The Red Lion is a really old country pub with a conservatory restaurant on the back. They have a blackboard of specials, from which I had the swordfish cooked in Thai spices and coconut milk which was quite different and tasty. We got there just before the restaurant opened and by the time we'd worked out what we were having, the restaurant area was almost full!
