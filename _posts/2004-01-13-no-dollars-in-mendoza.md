We woke up quite early, after not much sleep as the room was very stuffy - decided to get packed up and leave the hostel as soon as possible. We tried to pay in dollars, but they wouldn't accept it as the note had got a mark on it in pen - so we had to go to the cash machine and get more pesos for them and head back to the hostel before breakfast! We had breakfast at a cafe in one of the main streets and then headed off to try and get some dollars out of the bank to pay Jorge. We looked around a bit, and in the afternoon we went to the shopping centre to pass some time before catching the bus to Buenos Aires.
