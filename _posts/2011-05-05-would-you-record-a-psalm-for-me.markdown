For a while, I've been wondering about putting together a different kind of audio bible, one with a different person reading each chapter, but I didn't get very far with it - so I've decided to test this out and collect recordings of the first 30 psalms for my 30th birthday. 

So please could you record me a psalm for my birthday?

Reserve your psalm in the comments below and then you can either post a link to the recording or email me the file ( ricky at this domain). Please can you include with the recording which Psalm it is and your name. 

I will share all the recordings with those who record one, so sending me one recording should hopefully get you a set of 30 psalms!
