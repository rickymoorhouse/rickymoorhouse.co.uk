Well I've now been a dad for almost a week, and it's been quite an adventure. I've really enjoyed it, it's such a privellidge to have this sort of responsibility to look after someone. 




Abi has been a wonderful baby - she's such a calm quiet baby, and even when she gets excited, or frustrated, she's still not loud. There's been so much going on this week, it feels like it's been longer than that, but I'll just try and sum up some of the highlights here if I can keep typing one handed (Abi is asleep on my other arm). 





One key thing we've found this week though is that although there's [lots](http://www.babyworld.co.uk) [of](http://www.homebirth.org.uk/) [places](http://www.babycentre.co.uk) with fairly comprehensive information about pregnancy and giving birth online - there doesn't seem to be anything quite as comprehensive for looking after a new baby.
