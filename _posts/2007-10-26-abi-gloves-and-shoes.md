Today we took Abi to get her first real shoes - we'd originally tried to go yesterday, but were too close to the closing time for Clarks so they could just measure her, but there wasn't time to sell us any shoes (huh?). Today we managed to get there in plenty of time, had her measured again and then had to choose the shoes - we ended up with these lovely ones (which Abi really likes):

Then tonight as she was going to bed, Abi found a glove in her bed (like you do ;)) and stood up, tried to put it on, winged a bit, handed it to me and held out her hand. I put the glove on, she was happy, laid down and went to sleep!!
