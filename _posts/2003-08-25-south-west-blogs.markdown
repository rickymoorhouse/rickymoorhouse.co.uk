After seeing London Bloggers and DC Metro Blog Map, I decided to make a blog map for the south west of England based on the South West Trains network map - So you have South West Blogs! Currently it's available at http://www.samespirit.net/map/, but I'll probably give it a better URL soon. Feel free to add your sites and send me comments!
