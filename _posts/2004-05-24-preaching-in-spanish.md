Today I preached in Spanish for the first time up at the chapel. The passages were 1 Samuel 12:19-25 and John 17:20-26. While I was preparing it in the week I was very nervous, but once I'd got it finished, translated with Laura's expert help and read it through a couple of times I felt much more confident! You can read it on our website: [English](http://www.samespirit.net/articles/2004-05-23) or [Spanish](http://www.stuff.samespirit.net/articles/2004-05-23).  Preaching up there was interesting, as people often find it difficult to understand my Spanish, as I can't roll my R's enough for them to notice them, however I think most people followed at least some of it, and were appreciative.
