Found a link to this cool [colour toy](http://defencemechanism.com/color/color_toy_fr.htm) today -which I prefer to the previous one I'd seen as this will work in Mozillla too! Got a rough draft of my sermon together, now just to neaten it up around the edges, and probably add some illustrations. Also went to see Comedy of Errors at Stanstead House tonight - it was brilliant, really funny - I thoroughly enjoyed it!
