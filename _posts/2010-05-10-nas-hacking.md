A while back, we close to filling up the partition on our desktop machine with photos, so I decided to get a second hard drive.  In the end, instead of a hard drive, I decided to by the [WD My Book World Edition](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=586) which is a basic Linux server with a 1TB hard drive.

Here's my notes on what I've done with it so far:



	
  * Enable ssh

	
  * Install optware

	
  * Install some useful optware packages (e.g. cron, perl etc)

	
  * Re-configure the system using prep_whitelight.sh

	
  * Write script to tweet system status

	
  * Write script to report stats to MySQL database online

	
  * Build [views to show the stats](http://rickymoorhouse.co.uk/nas/)
