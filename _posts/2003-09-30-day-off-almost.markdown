Went to Punto Carretas Shopping with Tricia, Jonathan and Isaac. We had a chat and a drink with them Ã”?? I had a Licuado, which is liquidised fruit, topped up with fruit juice, milk or water. We then went shopping on our own for a bit and got lost on the way back. This turned out to be good for ourSpanish though!!In the evening we cooked dinner for Daniel and ourselves. We were goingto make pasta bake, but ended up with just pasta in sauce.
