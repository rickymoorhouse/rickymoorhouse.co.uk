I fly today at 5 o'clock to Varna, and then I've got no idea where I'll be staying ([?](http://www.goldensands.bg/map/index.asp)). I'm looking forward to it, but I'm not really sure what to expect there. I've set up my phone so I can use it there, but vodaphone charge Â£1.69 per minute for calls in Bulgaria, so I might get a sim card out there. A few useful links I might need:
