[Elasticsearch Server Second Edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JXLF7AK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00JXLF7AK&linkCode=as2&tag=samespirit-21) is a good book to read if you're getting started with Elasticsearch or considering using it. It goes through all the main areas of getting your data indexed and then searching and analysing it.

The book is well written and easy to read through and serves well as a reference guide to refer back to later. It has helped me get an overview of some of the features of Elasticseach that I've not yet used, some of which I hope to explore in further depth following on from the examples in the book. All of the chapters in the book include useful references to sources for further information on the topic covered and for more in-depth coverage the authors recommend going on to read their other book, [Mastering Elasticsearch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00G9581GA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00G9581GA&linkCode=as2&tag=samespirit-21) which I hope to read as well as a follow on.
