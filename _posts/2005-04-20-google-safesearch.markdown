Today we had an interesting experience with [Google's SafeSearch](http://www.google.com/safesearch_help.html), in that when you searched Google for "[church southsea](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=church+southsea)" you got a quite different set of results with SafeSearch on and SafeSearch off, notably for us - that our [church website](http://www.stlukessouthsea.org.uk) was 2nd on the list with SafeSearch switched off, however didn't appear until the second page with SafeSearch turned on. It would be interesting to know how SafeSearch works, as from looking at the results it seemed like it was using quite a different index.   
  


I contacted [Google](http://www.google.co.uk) using their contact form, and it seems like they've made a change, as now the website has moved back into the first page of results.
