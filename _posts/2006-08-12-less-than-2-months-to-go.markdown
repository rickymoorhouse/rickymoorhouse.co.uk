Time is flying by - Laura is now 32 weeks pregnent so we've got less than 2 months left before our little daughter is due to arrive. It's exciting and at the same time scary! I'm really looking forward to being a dad, but it's quite daunting at the same time





The other morning before I went to work, Laura was very tired and had drifted back off to sleep, I put my hand on her bump, and our little baby recognised my hand there and started kicking (or poking) my hand - It was lovely! 





We've been busy getting things ready and have built up a list of things we need to buy. This week we've been focusing on getting the bedroom ready. All the walls are now painted and we're working on tidying up and repainting the woodwork.
