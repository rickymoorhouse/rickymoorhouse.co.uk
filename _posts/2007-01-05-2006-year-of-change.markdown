2006 has been quite a year for us - lots and lots has happened and changed. Laura has done a great summary of her highs and lows for the year, and here's my year...

#### New Baby




In February, whilst away for the weekend we found out that Laura was pregnant. This was great news, as we'd been praying for a baby.  On my birthday, [we felt Abi kick for the first time](http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/230/) which was incredible, as was seeing her moving about on the scan pictures (no wonder she's so active now!).
In October after <a href="http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/242/"quite a long early labour at 9pm on the 8th, [Abigail was born](http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/244/) and it's been an amazing journey ever since. It's just incredible watching her grow and develop!





#### New House




For a while, we'd been hoping to move to somewhere with a bit more space, but with the imminent arrival, this became more urgent. After having the flat up for sale for a long time we thought we had found a buyer, so we set things moving on buying our new house. Unfortunately they pulled out part way into the process so we were left in an awkward position for a while - but thankfully my parents bought the flat from us to enable us to get moving quicker ready for the baby. So in May we [moved to our new house](http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/232/). Since then there's been all sorts of bits we've done with it - decorating, changing the toilet and [preparing the nursery](http://samespirit.net/ricky/news/234/).





#### New Church




Also this year we've starting going to [Paulsgrove Baptist Church](http://paulsgrove.org.uk) - which has been brilliant for us. We've joined a life group and feel really at home there.





#### New Job




Back in June, I moved jobs within the same department at work. Previously I had been working in the DB2 team, and I moved to a role as an Application Developer. This is much more of the sort of work I enjoy and had wanted to do, working on LAMP  based Web Applications.
  *[LAMP ]: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl
