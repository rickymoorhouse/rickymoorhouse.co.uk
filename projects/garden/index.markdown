This year we've really got into gardening, probably mostly kick-started by the healthy eating project at the Stacey Centre.  This is a place to keep notes on what we're growing etc.


## Strawberries


The girls received a strawberry plant each when they went to the first open day at the Stacey Centre [when].  We've re-potted them twice - once into larger pots into the greenhouse and then into a planter, starting in the greenhouse and moved outside once it got warm.

[15 May 2011] They've now got lots of fruit coming on them and the first strawberry is ready to eat.


## Tomatoes


Grown from plant and seed, initially indoors, then in the greenhouse

[15 May 2011] moved the seedlings into hanging baskets with Basil. The ones we got as plants are now flowering well


## Carrots


Grown from seed indoors, then moved to greenhouse.


## Broccoli


Grown from seed indoors, then moved to greenhouse.


## Peppers


Growing indoors


## Leek and Spring Onion


Started indoors from seed, moving to greenhouse and then to a grow bag
