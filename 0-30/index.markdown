To celebrate my 30th birthday, I decided it would be nice to collect some memories together for each year of my life so far, so with help from my mum I've got a collection of photos put together - one for each year.  This will probably continue to be a work in progress and some of the photos will change over time as I find different ones - as I still haven't found my baptism photos to use for when I was 19.
